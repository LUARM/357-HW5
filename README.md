Shell command-line parsing:
This assignment is to do the command-line parsing necessary for the Minimally Useful SHell (mush) that will be the subject of Asgn 6.
The Minimally Useful SHell (mush) has nowhere near the functionality of a full-blown shell like /bin/sh or /bin/csh, but it does support both file redirection and pipes. parseline is a subset of the shell that prompts for and reads a single mush command-line and parses it into a list of commands showing the inputs, outputs, and arguments of each.
